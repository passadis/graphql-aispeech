<h1 align="center">How to develop GraphQL with Azure AI Speech</h1>


## Introduction
A modern web application that leverages GraphQL, Azure AI Speech Services, and Azure CosmosDB to provide seamless audio file transcription capabilities.

## Features
- **Audio File Upload:** Upload audio files through a GraphQL mutation
- **Automatic Transcription:** Azure AI Speech Services integration for accurate speech-to-text conversion
- **File Storage:** Secure file storage using Azure Blob Storage
- **Transcription Management:** Query and manage your transcriptions through GraphQL
- **File Download:** Direct download links for processed audio files

## Tools and Technologies
- **Frontend**: React-based user interface for seamless user interaction.
- **Backend**: NodeJS with ExpressJS serving an Apollo GraphQL Server.
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform for infrastructure as code and\or Azure CLI.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the powerful combination of GraphQL and Azure AI services, showcasing how modern web applications can handle complex audio processing workflows with elegance and efficiency. By leveraging GraphQL's flexible data fetching capabilities alongside Azure's robust cloud infrastructure, we've created a scalable solution that streamlines the audio transcription process from upload to delivery. The integration of Apollo Server provides a clean, type-safe API layer that simplifies client-server communication, while Azure AI Speech Services ensures accurate transcription results. This architecture not only delivers a superior developer experience but also provides end-users with a seamless, professional-grade audio transcription service.
